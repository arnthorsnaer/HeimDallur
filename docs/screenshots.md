# UI Screenshots

All screenshots are generated from mock data via `scripts/capture_all.py` and committed to `docs/screenshots/`.

## Status screen

The main view, always visible. Three panels stack vertically: Internet, Home Network, and a collapsible status banner at the top. Each panel shows a bold online/offline indicator with a live duration ticker and a rolling-average summary line. Click a panel or press the shortcut key to expand it for sparklines and detail.

---

### All healthy

Everything reachable — internet, router, access points, and all devices. The status banner is collapsed since there is nothing to report.

### Email notifications configured

Same healthy state, but with a Gmail incident-report address configured. The footer shows the admin email address in place of the default "no email configured" placeholder.

### Internet degraded

Latency is elevated and packet loss is intermittent, but connectivity is maintained. The Internet panel changes colour and the rolling-average summary reflects the degraded quality; the status banner expands to name the fault.

---

### Internet offline

Complete loss of internet connectivity — IP, DNS, and HTTP checks all failing. The Internet panel shows `✗ OFFLINE` and the status banner surfaces the diagnosis.

---

### Router offline

The router is unreachable. Because all downstream devices depend on the router, every access point and device is shown as `UNKNOWN` rather than individually failed — fault cascade keeps the signal-to-noise ratio low and points to the root cause.

---

### AP offline

One access point (Basement) is down. Its nine downstream devices are suppressed to `UNKNOWN`, while all other groups remain unaffected. Only the root-cause AP is highlighted.

---

### Multiple issues

A compound failure: an access point is offline, internet connectivity is degraded, and one device is flapping intermittently. The status banner lists every active fault; each affected panel reflects its own state independently.

## Expanded panel views

Click any panel or press `i` (Internet) / `n` (Home Network) to expand it. The panel border subtitle changes from `▾` to `▴` and the detail view replaces the summary line.

---

### Internet panel — all healthy

The expanded Internet panel shows a latency sparkline, per-check results (IP reachability, DNS, HTTP) grouped by target, and the latest speed test reading with a historical average. Healthy targets are shown compactly; only degraded or failing targets get a detail row.

---

### Internet panel — partial failure

The same expanded view under a partial failure: one DNS resolver is failing while others pass, surfacing a plain-language diagnosis at the top of the panel ("All DNS failing — ISP resolver issue — try manual DNS").

---

### Home network panel

The expanded Home Network panel shows router latency, memory usage, uptime, and per-group device counts. Each access point group lists its downstream devices with individual latency and online/offline status.

## Other screens

Press `h` for the history screen or `d` for the device list. Both screens are pushed onto the screen stack; press `q` or `Escape` to return to the status screen.

---

### History screen

24-hour uptime bars per network segment, updated on each probe cycle. Each bar represents a 30-minute window; colour indicates healthy / degraded / offline.

| ![History screen](screenshots/09-history-screen.png) |
|:---:|

---

### Devices screen

Full device inventory with live latency and status per device, grouped by access point. Devices whose gateway is offline are shown as `UNKNOWN` rather than individually failed, consistent with the cascade logic on the status screen.
